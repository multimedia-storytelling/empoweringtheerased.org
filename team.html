For centuries it has been controlled by the same group of people. They have pushed this glossed over image and story of history. It has been impossible to go against this narrative because of the power they hold.But now those in the minority are finally able to tell their story. To tell the full truth. Now maybe a tide has turned, and people can know what has really happened throughout time. The truth”— Julian Beaujeu-Dufour</p>

                <p class="paragraph-12">The decade-long Mine Wars began in 1911, when coal miners in West Virginia began demanding better working conditions. They wanted a 40-hour work week instead of a schedule determined by how many pounds of coal they could dig. They sought safer working conditions to protect them from explosions and mine shaft collapses. They asked to be paid in real money instead of “scrip,” which they could only use in mine company stores, where they were forced to buy food, clothing, and the equipment they needed to dig coal. Significantly, the miners wanted the right to unionize and to become part of the United Mine Workers of America.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-23">Guatemala<br>Back in the classroom in Lexington, Prof. Green’s students connected their trip to Matewan with the plight of the Mayan people in Guatemala. Like the coal miners in West Virginia, the Mayans were exploited by corporate interests. Descendants of Spanish colonizers pushed Mayan people off their land and on to fincas, which were farms meant for growing cash crops to sell in international markets. On the fincas, indigenous people were forced to work long hours in unsafe conditions, and like the West Virginia miners, they were paid in scrip, which could only be spent in company stores.<br> <br>“By more or less forcing the indigenous people to work on the fincas, keeping them there, robbing them of their wages, and making sure any wages they did earn were spent back at the finca buying food and other necessities, the ladinos or the dominant class were able to ensure that the indigenous people stayed at the finca”—Sam Wise<br>‍<br>In a civil war that broke out in 1960, left-wing guerilla groups battled government military forces to overthrow the autocratic rule of Miguel Ydigoras Fuentes. In the 1970s, Mayan people began participating in the fight, demanding greater inclusion and recognition of their language and culture in the country.<br><br>The 36-year long conflict was characterized by abductions and violence, and over 200,000Guatemalans were killed or went missing. Eighty-three percent of the victim skilled in the war were Mayan, according to The Center for Justice and Accountability, a nonprofit foundation based in San Francisco that seeks to bring human rights abusers to justice.<br><br>“In what world do we live in now that simply eradicating a people, rather than reaching an agreement with or somehow relocating the communities, is the answer to obtaining the land that is desired? This is the colonial present”—Elena Lee<br><br>“The Guatemalan’s government lack of actually admitting to this action has aided in rewriting the historical memory of their attempted genocide, even with the affair being called in colloquia the ‘Guatemalan Civil War,’ instead of something like ‘the Guatemalan Mayan Genocide’”—Blake Ramsey</p><img src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/plugins/Basic/assets/placeholder.60f9b1840c.svg" loading="lazy" width="993" alt="" class="image-28">
